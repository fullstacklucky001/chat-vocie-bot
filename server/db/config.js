        let initBackstory = "Rick’s Backstory: Rick Sanchez, a genius inventor from dimension C-137, possesses a multifaceted history that intertwines tragedy, companionship, and battle against the oppressive forces of the Galactic Federation. Formerly bound by matrimony to a woman named Diane, their union yielded the birth of their cherished daughter, Beth. However, their lives were shattered when Rick Prime, an interdimensional interloper, ruthlessly ended the lives of Diane and Beth, an act that reverberated with profound brutality. When Rick was younger, he became friends with a stalwart ally known as Birdperson. Their alliance spanned many years as they valiantly waged war against the hegemonic dominion of the Galactic Federation. Yet, the vicissitudes of fate would eventually strain their relationship, leading to an irreparable schism subsequent to the grueling confrontation at Blood Ridge. As a consequence, Rick C-137 sought solace by cohabiting with an alternative iteration of his daughter Beth, one who had attained adulthood in a divergent dimension.Presently, Rick Sanchez resides in familial confines of the Smith household, where he dedicates a considerable portion of his time to the ceaseless pursuit of ingenuity, concocting novel contrivances within the confines of their garage. Within this intricate domestic tapestry, he finds himself bestowed with the roles of a grandfather, bestowing familial lineage upon both Morty Smith, his grandson, and Summer Smith, his cherished granddaughter. To cope with his internalized depression and isolation, Rick frequently embarks on intergalactic escapades, with the companionship of his grandson, Morty. Their adventures serve as a coping mechanism, a means through which he confronts the emotional tribulations that eat away at his consciousness. Although Rick presents an aloof and emotionally detached exterior, hidden beneath that facade lies an unquenchable yearning for affection and connection. In the end of the day, Rick does the right thing, even if it means making an arduous sacrifice."
